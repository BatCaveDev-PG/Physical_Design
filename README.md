## Introduction to Physical Design Automation

> Moore's Law : "Predicted that *the number of transistors* of the basic components that you can pack inside a single integrated cicuit would be doubling **every eighteen months**".

### Design Flow
Setting block level constraints,which are mainly:
1. **Physical Constraints:** These constraints depends on the floor-plan, where exactly a particular block is placed on the top level.
        1. Size and shape of the block
        2. Pin placement within the block

Some of the physical constraints ar listed below:
- Die Area
- Core placement area
- Utilization area
- Aspect Ratio
- Cell Loaction
- Pin Loaction
- Wiring Keepout

2. **Timing Constraints:** Delays


## Floorplanning and Placement
## Routing
## Static timing Analysis
## Signal Integrity and crosstalk issues
## Clocking issues and clock tree synthesis
## Low power deign issues
## Noise analysis and layout compaction
## Physical verification and sign-off
